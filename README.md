# UIkit starter template for Laravel 8
## Including authentication scaffolding for Laravel Fortify

![](https://torrix.uk/laravel-uikit.jpg)

Out of the box, Laravel 8 ships with a default welcome template built with 
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). On top of the base framework,
[Laravel JetStream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/) provides two user 
interfaces (your choice of Laravel Livewire or InertiaJS) for login and 
register pages whilst [Laravel Fortify](https://github.com/laravel/fortify) 
provides the authentication backend.

Although Tailwind CSS is quickly gaining popularity, many people, like me, 
prefer a more traditional front-end framework, like Bootstrap, Foundation, or 
Bulma. I choose **[UIkit](https://getuikit.com/)** by 
[YOOtheme](https://yootheme.com/) because I found it to be the 
most modern, clean, well-thought-out, and modular framework available.

## Why UIkit?

I've used UIkit for just about every project I've worked on in the last few 
years, for both websites and web applications, from tiny single-page landing 
sites, to massive web applications with thousands of users.

This package enhances Laravel with a starter template for UIkit, and 
gives you everything you need to start your next web project.

## What's included?

* UIkit package (installed via composer)
* Sass starter file, to customise your UIkit CSS
* JavaScript to load UIkit libraries
* Welcome page
* UIkit demo page
* Optional views for:
    * Log In
    * Register
    * Forgot Password
    * Reset Password
    * Verify Email
    
## What's still to come?

* Profile pages
* Two-factor authentication

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes. See Deployment for notes 
on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To begin, you'll need a **fresh** install of Laravel 8. **Adding this to an 
existing project is not recommended and may cause issues**. For full 
instructions on installing Laravel, refer to the 
[Laravel installation docs](https://laravel.com/docs/master/installation), but 
something like the following will get you up and running:

```
composer global require laravel/installer

laravel new mysite

cd mysite
```

### Installing this preset

To turn the base Laravel installation into a UIkit site, follow the steps 
below.

1. Include this repository into your composer dependencies:
```
composer require torrix/laravel-uikit
```
2. Run the artisan command to publish the necessary files into your Laravel 
install. It will overwrite welcome.blade.php, so do not run this on established 
projects with changes made to that file.
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Torrix\LaravelUikitServiceProvider" --force
```
3. (optional) Include Laravel Fortify, if you want to make use of the 
ready-made authentication system. You will need to create a database, and 
configure the file `.env` with the correct credentials for it.
```
composer require laravel/fortify

php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Fortify\FortifyServiceProvider"

php artisan migrate
```

Add in `config/app.php`:

```
 'providers' => [
        // ...
        App\Providers\FortifyServiceProvider::class,
    ],
```

4. Run NPM to build your CSS and JS assets using Laravel Mix:
```
npm install && npm run dev
```
Sometimes, `npm run dev` needs to be run twice to complete the installation. 
Read the output carefully to see if this is the case.

5. Run the built-in development server
```
php artisan serve
```
Your new site will be served at http://localhost:8000.

## Developing with UIkit

To get started in UIkit, read 
[their excellent docs](https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction). The examples 
and tests provided should give you all the help you need. To get an idea of 
what UIkit is capable of, I highly recommend the 
[KickOff starter templates](https://zzseba78.github.io/Kick-Off/) for 
inspiration. 

To start customising UIkit to your own needs, take a look in 
[app.scss](resources/sass/app.scss). In there, you will find the 
standard UIkit imports, and by way of a simple example, I've changed the 
default blue primary colour to a nice purple shade, just to show what's 
possible in almost no time at all. Try changing it to another colour, and 
then running `npm run dev` to rebuild the CSS, and see the changes to your 
site.

### Handy tip

Whilst developing your site, running Laravel Mix in watch mode makes it easy 
to make changes and quickly see their results:

```
npm run watch
```

## Deployment

When deploying to a live server, remember to build your assets in production 
mode for smaller, faster downloads:
```
npm run prod
```

## Built With
